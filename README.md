# Personality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is an **Introvert** or an **Extrovert** based on their behavioral patterns using a logistic regression model. The solution combines data preprocessing, machine learning, an interactive Jupyter Notebook interface, and Power BI visualizations.
